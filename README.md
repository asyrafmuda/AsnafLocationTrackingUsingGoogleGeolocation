# AsnafLocationTrackingUsingGoogleGeolocation
Asnaf Location Tracking is a mobile web application that helps people to find the nearest asnaf based on the userâ€™s current position and other spesification like area, region, and state. 

The web applications require internet connection in order to fetch and display the result because the data were pulled from the database. Although Google Map Api limitations is that need the internet connection to detect the location of the user. If the internet connection is unavailable, users cannot view pinpoint location of asnaf house on a map and will be navigated to them. 

For this project, there are two types of users: users of mobile web application and administrators. Each type of users has their own task and functionality. User will use mobile web application to find nearest asnaf in their current location. Other than that user also able to search for asnafs, choose an asnaf from that search and then navigate to it. While the administrators will manage the overall system so there is no incorrect information within it. Other functionality of administrator is that the admin have an visualization of map view in order to search and locate the nearest asnaf location by using shortest path algorithm, such as Dijkstra and Travelling salesman problem algorithm.
